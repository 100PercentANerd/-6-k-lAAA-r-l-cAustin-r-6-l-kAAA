## KEEPING UP TO DATE

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Git must be installed.

This pack will have two update files
```update.sh``` and ```update.bat```
If you're on Windows run ```update.bat``` if you're on MacOS, Linux or anything else using the bash/zsh/etc terminal, run ```update.sh```

> [!TIP]
> The folder (probably) needs to be unzipped for you to run the ```update``` file.
